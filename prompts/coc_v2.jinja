{{ question }}
You are given an image along with a question that requires spatial reasoning.
To describe or reference specific locations in the image, use 2D coordinates in the format (x, y), where x is the horizontal axis and y is the vertical axis, starting from the top-left corner as (0, 0).
Leverage both the visual details and spatial relationships among elements in the image to reason through the problem.
In your answer, clearly explain your reasoning and refer to coordinates as needed to support your conclusion.

Now answer the question based on the image and provided facts.
